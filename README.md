If you’re just getting started as C++ developer, you need to learn the fundamentals of common data structures. This course lets you practice new skills with extended coding challenges and solutions. By using real-world examples in a hands-on interactive learning space, instructor Károly Nyisztor helps you develop your understanding of core concepts and common data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. Along the way, explore techniques to improve and optimize your overall performance following industry-standard best practices for memory management.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.
